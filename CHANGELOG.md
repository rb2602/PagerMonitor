# Changelog

All notable changes to PagerMonitor are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR** — breaking change (e.g. DB migration requiring manual step, config rename)
- **MINOR** — new feature, backward compatible
- **PATCH** — bug fix, small improvement

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-21

### Added
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)** — installable on Android, iOS, and desktop Chrome/Edge. Add to home screen for a native app feel with standalone window and no browser bar
- **Background push notifications** — browser/OS-level notifications delivered even when the app is closed. Uses Web Push API with VAPID keys (auto-generated on first start, stored in DB)
- **Service worker** — caches the app shell for faster loads; network-first for API calls
- **PWA icons** — 192×192 and 512×512 PNG icons auto-generated from `favicon.svg` as part of `npm run build`
- **Bell button now dual-purpose** — enabling browser notifications also subscribes the device to background push. Disabling unsubscribes
- **Minor bug fixes**

### Notes
- VAPID keys are generated automatically on first backend start and stored in the database — no manual configuration needed
- Push subscriptions are stored per-user; guest/public users cannot subscribe
- Push respects the existing global notification filter (Admin → Notifications → Filter)

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Multiple SDR dongles** — run parallel rtl_fm/multimon-ng pipelines, each on its own frequency. Configure per-dongle in Admin → SDR Control or via `DONGLES` env var
- **Per-dongle status indicators** — StatusBar shows one dot per dongle; green = OK, amber = partial, red = all down. Hover for details
- **Message notes & annotations** — add shared or private notes to any message. Note count badge on each row
- **Per-user email notifications** — each user sets their own filter (all / by group / by alias / by capcode / by keyword)
- **Email (SMTP) support** — HTML-formatted notifications with Google Maps button when coordinates available
- **Password reset via email** — "Forgot password" on login sends a time-limited reset link
- **Editor role** — new role between admin and viewer: can manage aliases, groups, highlights, keyword alerts
- **Activity feed** — compact recent-changes panel embedded in Aliases and Groups pages
- **Load more** — "Load more" button in feed fetches older messages beyond the initial 200
- **Archive CSV export** — download archive as CSV from the Archive panel
- **Cluster map icon** — replaced text label with SVG icon
- **Health check endpoint** — `/health` returns uptime, DB stats, memory, SDR status
- **Docker improvements** — single `docker-compose.yml` with profiles, `Makefile` with `make start/stop/logs/update`, `.env.example` at root
- **Notification improvements** — alias, group name, and Google Maps link in all notification services (Discord, Telegram, Gotify, Pushover, Email)
- **Backup & Restore** — includes WAL file in size calculation, accurate last-modified date
- **User management** — email field on create/edit user, edit button with inline panel
- **SSL toggle auto-switches port** — checking SSL/TLS in email config auto-sets port 465/587

### Fixed
- Login page blank page (missing `form` state)
- Hooks violation in App.jsx (conditional return before hooks)
- `updateUserPassword` missing from database exports
- Duplicate `/auth/me` route shadowing email field
- Role validation rejecting `editor` on registration
- Double restart when switching multi→single dongle mode
