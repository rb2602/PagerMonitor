# PagerMonitor — Real-Time Pager Monitoring System

Decode POCSAG/FLEX pager transmissions with an RTL-SDR dongle and monitor them live from any browser.

---

## How it works

```
RTL-SDR dongle(s)
      │
  rtl_fm        — tunes to frequency, outputs raw PCM audio
      │
multimon-ng     — decodes POCSAG/FLEX protocol from audio
      │
Node.js server  — stores messages, serves web UI, sends notifications
      │
  Browser       — live feed via WebSocket, map, search, admin panel
```

---

## Deployment options

### Option A — Single device (RPi with SDR dongle)

RTL-SDR plugged directly into the Pi. Everything on one machine.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Raspberry Pi (with RTL-SDR dongle)        │
│                                             │
│   rtl_fm → multimon-ng → Node.js server    │
│   React web UI (port 3000)                  │
│   SQLite database                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↑ any browser on your network
```

### Option B — Distributed (RPi client + server)

Minimal decoder on the Pi, everything else on a server (Proxmox VM, NAS, PC).

```
┌──────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Raspberry Pi         │        │  Server (Proxmox / NAS / PC)        │
│  (with RTL-SDR)       │  HTTP  │                                     │
│                       │ ─────► │  Node.js server (port 3000)         │
│  rtl_fm               │  POST  │  SQLite database                    │
│  multimon-ng          │        │  React web UI + admin panel         │
│  pagermonitor-client  │        │  Notifications + webhooks           │
└──────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                                          ↑ all browsers connect here
```

Multiple RPi clients can forward to the same server — useful for monitoring multiple frequencies from different locations.

## Quick start

### Native install (systemd)

#### Option A — Single device

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
# Note: multimon-ng latest is built automatically from source by install.sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y rtl-sdr nodejs npm

# 2. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/dj3ky/pagermonitor.git ~/pagermonitor
cd ~/pagermonitor
bash install.sh

# 3. Configure
nano ~/pagermonitor/backend/.env
# Set RTL_FM_FREQ to your local pager frequency

# 4. Start
sudo systemctl start pagermonitor

# 5. Open browser
# http://<pi-ip>:3000
# Login: admin / <see "First login" section below for the password>
```

#### Option B — Server (no SDR dongle)

Run this on the machine that will host the web UI and database (Proxmox VM, NAS, PC).
No RTL-SDR hardware required — the RPi client (next section) forwards decoded messages here.

```bash
# 1. Install Node.js only (no SDR tools needed)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

# 2. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/dj3ky/pagermonitor.git ~/pagermonitor
cd ~/pagermonitor
bash install.sh --server

# 3. Configure
nano ~/pagermonitor/backend/.env
# Set DISABLE_SDR=true

# 4. Start
sudo systemctl start pagermonitor

# 5. Open browser and generate a client key for the RPi
# http://<server-ip>:3000
# Login: admin / <see "First login" section below for the password>
# Then: Admin → Client Key → Generate → copy the key
```

#### Option B — RPi client

Run this on the Raspberry Pi with the RTL-SDR dongle. It decodes pager traffic and
forwards it to the server set up above. No web UI runs on the Pi itself.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
# Note: multimon-ng latest is built automatically from source by client/install.sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y rtl-sdr nodejs npm

# 2. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/dj3ky/pagermonitor.git ~/pagermonitor

# 3. Run client installer (sets up systemd service pagermonitor-client)
cd ~/pagermonitor/client
bash install.sh

# 4. Configure
nano ~/pagermonitor/client/.env
# Required:
#   SERVER_URL=http://<server-ip>:3000
#   CLIENT_KEY=<key copied from Admin → Client Key on the server>
#   RTL_FM_FREQ=173.250M   (your local pager frequency)

# 5. Start
sudo systemctl start pagermonitor-client

# 6. Watch logs
sudo journalctl -u pagermonitor-client -f

# 7. Verify connection
# Server browser: Admin → SDR Clients — this Pi should appear as connected
```

### First login — finding your admin password

On first boot (empty database), PagerMonitor generates a random admin password and prints it once to the log:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u pagermonitor -n 50 --no-pager | grep "Default admin"
# ⚠  Default admin created  username=admin  password=3f9a1c...
```

**If you missed it**, set `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASS` in `backend/.env` and wipe the user table so the first-run setup runs again:

```bash
# Stop the service
sudo systemctl stop pagermonitor

# Remove the database (all messages will be lost — back up first if needed)
rm ~/pagermonitor/backend/data/pagermonitor.db

# Set a known password for next start
echo "DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASS=changeme123" >> ~/pagermonitor/backend/.env

# Start again — the password will now be "changeme123"
sudo systemctl start pagermonitor
```

Change the password immediately after login: **Admin → Users → admin → Change password**.

### Docker

```bash
# Option A — single device
cp .env.example .env && nano .env
make start

# Option B — server only (no SDR)
# Set DISABLE_SDR=true in .env
make start-server

# RPi client (on the Pi)
cp client/.env.example client/.env && nano client/.env
make start-client

# Logs, stop, update
make logs
make stop
make update
```

See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for full Docker documentation.

## Configuration

Edit `backend/.env` (native) or `.env` (Docker):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Web server port |
| `DISABLE_SDR` | `false` | `true` = server-only mode (no dongle) |
| `RTL_FM_FREQ` | `173.250M` | Pager frequency. Multiple: `173.250M:152.240M` |
| `RTL_FM_GAIN` | `40` | SDR gain in dB. `0` = auto AGC |
| `RTL_FM_PPM` | `0` | Frequency correction (run `rtl_test -p` to find) |
| `RTL_FM_DEVICE_INDEX` | `0` | Dongle index when using one dongle |
| `MULTIMON_PROTOCOLS` | `POCSAG1200` | Space-separated: `POCSAG512 POCSAG1200 FLEX` |
| `MULTIMON_POCSAG_CHARSET` | _(empty)_ | Charset: `US` (default), `FR`, `DE`, `SE`, `DK`, `SI` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `error` / `warn` / `info` / `debug` |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASS` | _(random)_ | First-run admin password. If unset, a random password is generated and printed to the startup log. |
| `OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID` / `OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET` | _(unset)_ | Optional OpenSky Network OAuth2 credentials for the Aircraft Tracking map — raises the poll rate from 5 min (anonymous, 400 credits/day) to 1 min (4000 credits/day). Can also be set in Admin → Site → Aircraft Tracking |
| `NAP_B2B_USER` / `NAP_B2B_PASS` | _(unset)_ | NAP (b2b.nap.si) B2B account credentials for the Traffic map (DARS/DRSI cameras, roadworks, VMS signs). Layer stays empty without them. Can also be set in Admin → Site → Traffic Data (NAP) |

All SDR settings can also be changed live in **Admin → SDR Control** without editing files.

### Regional data overlays (Slovenia)

Optional map layers for Slovenia-based deployments — Aircraft Tracking, Traffic (NAP), ARSO
Weather stations, and ARSO earthquakes. Each is independently toggleable under **Admin → Site
→ Optional Features** and makes no API calls at all while disabled. Weather and earthquake
layers need no credentials; Aircraft Tracking and Traffic work with reduced limits (or an
empty layer, for Traffic) until the optional credentials above are configured.

### Multiple SDR dongles

To run multiple dongles in parallel on one machine, set `DONGLES` as a JSON array:

```bash
# backend/.env (native) or .env (Docker)
DONGLES=[{"device":0,"freq":"173.250M","gain":"40","protocols":"POCSAG1200"},{"device":1,"freq":"152.240M","gain":"35","protocols":"POCSAG512 FLEX"}]
```

Or configure per-dongle in **Admin → SDR Control → Multiple SDR dongles**. The same applies
to remote RPi clients via **Admin → SDR Clients** — a client's dongle list is fully
config-driven from the server, no `.env` editing or SSH required once the client is running.

#### Identifying dongles by serial (recommended once you have 2+)

By default, dongles are addressed by USB enumeration order (`device: 0`, `1`, …), which is
**not stable** across reboots or replugs — if two dongles are attached, a reboot can silently
swap which one is `0` vs `1`. Most cheap RTL-SDR dongles also ship with the exact same factory
serial (`00000001`), so before relying on serial-based selection, burn a unique serial into
each one (one dongle plugged in at a time):

```bash
rtl_eeprom -d 0 -s PM-DONGLE-1
# unplug, plug in the next dongle, repeat with a different id
rtl_eeprom -d 0 -s PM-DONGLE-2
```

The new serial only takes effect after the dongle is unplugged and replugged (Linux caches
the USB descriptor until it re-enumerates). Do them **one dongle at a time** — with two
identical, unmodified dongles attached together, `-d 0` is ambiguous and you can't tell which
one you're writing to. If you have RTL-SDR Blog V4 dongles, make sure `rtl_eeprom` actually
comes from [RTL-SDR Blog's fork](https://github.com/rtlsdrblog/rtl-sdr-blog) (which
`install.sh`/`update.sh` already build for the reasons described below under "Voice channels")
rather than a stock/other `rtl-sdr` package — a stock build can misread or fail to write V4's
EEPROM. Check with `which rtl_eeprom` / `rtl_eeprom -d 0` (read-only) before writing.

**From Windows** (e.g. dongles normally plugged into a Windows PC rather than the Pi/server
directly): download `Release.zip` from the
[RTL-SDR Blog GitHub releases page](https://github.com/rtlsdrblog/rtl-sdr-blog/releases),
which bundles a `rtl_eeprom.exe` alongside `rtl_test.exe`/`rtl_sdr.exe`. If you haven't
already installed the WinUSB driver for these dongles (needed for any RTL-SDR software to see
them at all), do that first via Zadig, one dongle at a time. Then, from a Command Prompt in
the extracted folder:

```
rtl_eeprom.exe -d 0
rtl_eeprom.exe -d 0 -s PM-DONGLE-1
```

Same rules apply: read first, one dongle attached at a time, unplug/replug after writing.

⚠️ EEPROM writes carry a small risk of bricking a dongle if power drops mid-write (more of a
concern on cheap/counterfeit units) — uncommon, but worth knowing before you do this to
hardware you're relying on.

Once serials are set, pick each dongle from the **Serial** dropdown in Admin → SDR Control
(local dongles) or Admin → SDR Clients (remote Pis) instead of typing a device index — it's
populated from hardware actually detected on that machine. The `device` field remains as a
legacy fallback, only used when no serial is selected.

### Voice channels (listen live alongside POCSAG)

If your local pager frequency and a voice frequency (e.g. firefighter dispatch) sit within
~2MHz of each other, one dongle can decode POCSAG *and* stream voice channels live to the
browser at the same time, using [rtl_airband](https://github.com/rtl-airband/RTLSDR-Airband)
instead of `rtl_fm` for that dongle. rtl_airband demodulates continuously either way; audio
only actually transmits over the network while someone's really listening, relayed over the
same WebSocket connection already used for messages (low-latency PCM, no separate server or
port to run) — no inbound ports needed on the Pi.

1. `install.sh`/`update.sh` (and the client's equivalents) now build and install `rtl_airband`
   from source automatically — first run takes a few extra minutes to compile. It's
   best-effort (package names/build flags can vary by distro version), so check the
   installer's output or `sudo journalctl -u pagermonitor-client -n 50` if it fails.
2. Add your voice channels in **Admin → Voice Channels** (description, frequency, mode, squelch).
3. In **Admin → SDR Control → Multiple SDR dongles**, set a dongle's mode to *Multi
   (rtl_airband)* and check which channels it should decode alongside POCSAG.
4. That's it — assigned channels are pushed down automatically via the existing remote-config
   mechanism, and audio relays over the same `CLIENT_KEY`-authenticated connection used for
   messages. No extra password/service to configure.

**Voice-only dongles**: a second (or third) dongle doesn't have to carry POCSAG at all —
uncheck **Include POCSAG channel** on that dongle's airband settings to run it purely for
voice channels, with no multimon-ng process spawned for it. Useful once you've dedicated one
dongle to POCSAG and want another purely for wider-spread voice listening without the two
sharing capture bandwidth.

**Live listener counts**: Admin → Voice Channels shows a live count of who's currently
listening to each channel, with usernames on hover (anonymous/public-mode listeners show as
"guest"). **Auto-listen** can be armed per channel so it starts playing automatically the
instant it keys up, instead of waiting for someone to click play.

### Discord voice relay

Stream any configured voice channel live into a Discord voice channel via a bot — separate
from the Discord *message* notification service under Admin → Notifications.

1. Create a Discord bot at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications),
   enable the **Voice States** intent, and invite it to your server with `Connect` +
   `Speak` permissions.
2. Admin → SDR → Discord Relay → add a relay: pick the source voice channel (from Admin →
   Voice Channels), paste the bot token, guild ID, and target Discord voice channel ID, then
   enable it.
3. Multiple independent relay mappings are supported. One bot token can only join one voice
   channel per Discord server at a time — use a separate bot token if you need to relay two
   channels into the same server simultaneously.

Audio is resampled server-side; no native build tools are required (the pure-JS Opus/encryption
stack is used, not the native `@discordjs/opus`/`sodium-native` packages).

**Hardware requirement: Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 only.** rtl_airband's FFT channelizer is
meaningfully heavier than plain `rtl_fm` — confirmed in the field on Pi 1 and Pi 2 hardware,
both running rtl_airband even for POCSAG alone (no voice channels assigned at all):
- Pi 1 (+ RTL-SDR V4): 100% CPU, buffer overflow, but the pipeline stayed up (degraded, not down).
- Pi 2 (+ RTL-SDR V3): SDR went fully offline — a *harder* failure despite Pi 2 nominally
  having more CPU power than Pi 1, so the exact failure mode isn't purely about raw CPU
  headroom; the dongle model may also play a role. Not fully root-caused.

Only Pi 3 and Pi 4 are confirmed reliable so far. Until Pi 1/2 are understood better, leave
dongles on that hardware in single (`rtl_fm`) mode rather than multi/airband.

If you also have an RTL-SDR Blog dongle (V2/V3/V4), `install.sh`/`update.sh` also install
[RTL-SDR Blog's librtlsdr fork](https://github.com/rtlsdrblog/rtl-sdr-blog) automatically —
stock Debian librtlsdr can misbehave with these dongles (wrong gain tables/tuner detection),
especially under rtl_airband's more demanding real-time operation. A dongle that works fine
in single mode but fails to bring SDR up at all in multi mode is the telltale symptom.

## Updating

Always check [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) before updating — major version bumps may require manual steps.

### Native (systemd) — one command

```bash
cd ~/pagermonitor
bash update.sh
```

This does everything automatically:
1. `git pull` — latest code
2. `apt update && apt upgrade` — system packages
3. multimon-ng version check — upgrades from source if newer available
4. `npm install` + frontend rebuild
5. Restarts the service

**Or use the admin panel** — Admin → System → Update compares your installed commit with the latest on GitHub and has an **Update Now** button with live terminal output. The page reloads automatically when the service restarts.

> **RPi client** has no web UI — update via SSH: `cd ~/pagermonitor/client && bash update.sh`

### Docker

```bash
cd ~/pagermonitor
git pull
make update   # equivalent to: git pull + docker compose down + docker compose up -d --build
```

Or manually:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

### RPi client (distributed mode, native)

```bash
cd ~/pagermonitor/client
bash update.sh
```

### Check running version

Admin → System → Update shows installed commit vs latest on GitHub. Or:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/health | grep version
# → "version": "2.5.0"
```

### After a major version bump (x.0.0)

1. Read the CHANGELOG entry carefully — look for **Migration** or **Breaking** notes
2. Back up your database first: Admin → Backup & Restore → Download
3. Follow any manual steps listed in the CHANGELOG
4. Then update normally

Minor and patch versions are always safe — no manual steps needed.

## Troubleshooting

### RTL-SDR not detected

```bash
lsusb | grep -i realtek      # should show the dongle
rtl_test -t                  # tests basic detection

# Blacklist DVB driver (required for RTL-SDR to work)
echo 'blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/rtlsdr.conf
sudo modprobe -r dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger

# Check udev permissions
sudo usermod -aG plugdev $(whoami)   # log out + in after this
```

### No messages decoded

```bash
# Test reception — record 10 seconds and play back
rtl_fm -f 173.250M -M fm -s 22050 - | \
  sox -t raw -r 22050 -e s -b 16 -c 1 - test.wav

# Silent = wrong frequency
# Noise only = try different gain values (20, 30, 40, 50)
# Tones present but no decode = wrong protocol/baud, try POCSAG512 or FLEX
```

### Slovenian/special characters (Š Č Ž) not showing

Admin → SDR Control → **POCSAG charset (-C)** = `SI`

### SDR OFFLINE in status bar

Check Admin → Live Logs. Common causes:
- Another process holds the dongle: `fuser /dev/bus/usb/*`
- Wrong device index: try `RTL_FM_DEVICE_INDEX=1`
- DVB driver not blacklisted

### Multiple dongles: one shows as down

Each dongle needs either a unique serial (recommended — see "Identifying dongles by serial"
above) or a unique device index (`0`, `1`, `2`…, found with `rtl_test`) if you're not using
serials. The status bar shows one dot per dongle — green = OK, red = down. Hover for details.

### RPi client not connecting

```bash
curl http://<server-ip>:3000/client/status \
  -H "X-Client-Key: <your-key>"
# 200 OK = working
# 401 = wrong key
# Connection refused = wrong SERVER_URL or firewall
```

### Blank page after login

Clear browser cache and reload. If it persists, check the browser console for JavaScript errors and `sudo journalctl -u pagermonitor -n 30`.

### Mixed content / WebSocket broken over HTTPS

Use nginx to proxy both HTTP and WebSocket on the same port. See the nginx config in `docker/nginx-standalone.conf`.

### SD card longevity on Pi

```bash
# Reduce writes — set in backend/.env:
LOG_LEVEL=warn          # less logging
DB_PATH=/mnt/usb/pagermonitor.db  # move DB to USB SSD
```

---

## Raspberry Pi recommendations

- **Pi 4 (2GB+)** for Option A (single device). Pi 3B+ or Pi Zero 2W fine for Option B client.
- **Powered USB hub** if RTL-SDR causes USB instability.
- **USB SSD** for the database in high-message environments (extends SD card life).
- `vcgencmd measure_temp` — add heatsink/fan if consistently above 70°C.
